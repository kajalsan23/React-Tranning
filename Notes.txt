- What is Javascript?
It is a client-side scripting language that is used to apply some dynamic features in our web page line animations, event handling, validations, dom-manipulation, etc. 
-> Javascript is known as ECMAScript.
-> In web Browsers, Javascript consists of 3 main parts
1. ECMAScript provides the core functionality
2. DOM(Document Object Model) Provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages.
3. BOM(Browser Object Model) provides the browser API for interacting with the browser.
